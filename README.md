# sandbox
This is my own sandbox to test github functionality.

Like an image:

![ULS Graph](recalculated_energy.png)

That works!

Perhaps better to use a subdirectory 'images/...' for all images?

That allows an automated generation of a test plan/procedure, including images.

A Task List

- [x] @mentions, #refs, [link to myself](), **formatting**, and <del>tags</del> supported
- [x] list syntax required (any unordered or ~~ordered~~ list supported)
- [x] this is a complete item
- [ ] this is an incomplete item 


Just normal text.
